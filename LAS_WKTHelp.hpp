/****************************************  IMPORTANT NOTE  **********************************

    Comments in this file that start with / * ! or / / ! are being used by Doxygen to
    document the software.  Dashes in these comment blocks are used to create bullet lists.
    The lack of blank lines after a block of dash preceeded comments means that the next
    block of dash preceeded comments is a new, indented bullet list.  I've tried to keep the
    Doxygen formatting to a minimum but there are some other items (like <br> and <pre>)
    that need to be left alone.  If you see a comment that starts with / * ! or / / ! and
    there is something that looks a bit weird it is probably due to some arcane Doxygen
    syntax.  Be very careful modifying blocks of Doxygen comments.

//  The <b></b> is just forcing the program to assume it's rich text format.

QString wktLabelText = 
  LAS_WKT::tr ("<b></b>So, the problem with many LAS files is that the coordinate system is not defined properly.  Even though the LAS specification "
               "requires a 34735 (GeoKeyDirectoryTag) Variable Length Record (VLR) many people don't put one in.  If you're using LAS 1.4 and "
               "you use point data formats above 5 you are required to insert a Well-known Text (WKT) VLR or Extended VLR (eVLR).  Apparently many "
               "people think this is a waste of time.  I find that rather interesting, especially with projected data.  For example, I recently "
               "saw some data from a LiDAR system in use in Japan that was in LAS 1.4 format using point data format 6.  This requires a WKT "
               "VLR or eVLR but there wasn't one in the file.  The global_encoding field was set to indicate that there was a 34735 VLR. "
               "That is an error.  There wasn't even a 34735 VLR anyway.  Since the file appeared to be UTM what we had was a whole bunch of "
               "measurements (northing and easting, presumably in meters) from nowhere (or possibly OZ).<br><br>"
               "Even when people insert the 34735 record they often leave out important information.  For instance, I've seen files that proudly "
               "proclaim that they are NAD83 UTM but then they don't put the zone information into the record.  Once again, meters (we hope) from "
               "nowhere.<br><br>"
               "Another pet peeve of mine - why do people use any vertical measurement other than meters (or metres if you will)?  Measuring "
               "things based on the length of some king's body parts seems a bit old school.  Wait until you've finished processing the data "
               "before you convert it to cubits or fathoms or furlongs or feet or yards for the great unwashed masses to gaze upon.  ABE assumes "
               "that the input elevations are in meters.  If the data in your LAS file isn't in meters it doesn't really matter.  Just look at the "
               "pretty numbers and say to yourself <b>'self, that number is really feet even though it says meters'</b>.  If you're building PFMs "
               "from LAS files I wouldn't recommend trying to extract (pfmExtract or pfmGeotiff) the data (meaning X, Y, and Z, not validity and/or "
               "classification).<br><br>"
               "Now, on to the fun stuff, if you're not familiar with WKT you can look it up on the interwebs.  To quote Wikipedia <b>'Well-known text "
               "(WKT) is a text markup language for representing vector geometry objects on a map, spatial reference systems of spatial objects and "
               "transformations between spatial reference systems'</b>. The world has moved past the GeoKeyDirectoryTag and is moving to WKT. Since this "
               "program uses the GDAL/OGR library it only supports projected (PROJCS) or geographic (GEOGCS) coordinate systems.  That's probably fine "
               "since that's what most people use (the other possibility being (GEOCCS) geocentric).<br><br>"
               "This program will try to decipher the crazy quilt LAS oordinate system information but it won't try very hard.  If you are using "
               "geographic data it will probably make it through fine (unless you've completely hosed or forgotten your 34735).  Projected data is "
               "much more complicated. In any event, if the program can't figure it out it will ask you for a WKT describing the coordinate system for "
               "your data.  You can find a bunch of WKT over on <a href=\"http://spatialreference.org/\">spatialreference.org</a>.<br><br>"
               "Once you've entered one or more WKT definitions the program will try to keep track of the 10 most recently used ones. "
               "These will be available in any of the ABE programs that have LAS inputs.  Hopefully you'll be using the same few for quite a while "
               "before you have to change to another area and/or coordinate system.  To see what each recent WKT string looks like just open the combo box "
               "on the bottom left and let the cursor hover over each entry.  The tool tip will be the full text of the WKT in human readable "
               "form.<br><br>"
               "<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: In the pfmLoad or pfmLoader program, if you input LAS files and have to input WKT to load them, the program will "
               "keep track of the WKT and will use it again if you append to the existing PFM.</b><br><br>"
